The story is set in Rome, about the times after World War II, and revolves around Antonio Ricci, poor man who finally gets a job that could change his family’s difficult life, but the job depends on him having a bicycle. Unfortunately, his bicycle gets stolen and Antonio becomes desperate and starts searching all over the city, with his young son, Bruno, by his side. The movie ends on a sad note when Antonio, in complete despair, tries to steal a bicycle himself, but he is caught in front of his son, which makes the situation even more heartbreaking.</p> <h3 id="story-theme-and-design">Story Theme and Design</h3> <p>The movie centers on the struggle to maintain dignity even when life becomes overwhelmingly difficult. Antonio’s entire ability to earn a living depends on his bicycle, and when it’s stolen, it feels like his self-worth is slowly breaking apart. Even more sad point is that his family had to sell some of their blanket like stuff to earn enough money for that bicycle and they were quite happy about Antonio getting a job because now he will earn money. But soon after the stealing of bicycle, their situation became stressful. Antonio’s search for the bicycle isn’t just about finding it, it’s also about his role as a father, and his identity as a man trying to earn an honest living in tough times.</p> <h4 id="neorealism-style-of-filmmaking">“Neorealism” style of Filmmaking</h4> <p>The film is a great example of Italian neorealism, which focuses on ordinary people, real locations, and everyday struggles. The scenes of Rome’s streets, busy markets, and the chaotic bicycle market look very real, making the story feel alive and authentic. The use of nonprofessional actors adds to this realism, as their performances feel natural and unpolished. I also searched about the actors on wiki, and found that the actor who played Antonio was also a factory worker before that. This style helps the audience connect with the daily hardships of regular people, making Antonio’s struggles feel relatable and emotionally powerful.</p> <h4 id="adorable-display-of-father-son-relationship">Adorable display of Father-Son relationship</h4> <p>The bond between Antonio and his son Bruno is a key emotional part of the film. Even though Bruno is just a child, he often guides his father’s actions, watching him with love, admiration, and later, disappointment. Their relationship brings warmth and humor, especially through Bruno’s innocence. His facial expressions show a range of emotions, from happiness to worry, and his presence during his father’s moral struggles makes the story even more touching. I personally found the actor of Bruno to be too awesome, if we think about him being just a 9 year old kid at that time. Upon googling about him, I also found that he is still alive (84 years old), and an interesting point is that he became a maths teacher when he grew up as adult.</p> <h3 id="character-portrayal">Character Portrayal</h3> <p>The main character, Antonio Ricci, is a man desperate to take care of his family. Throughout the movie, his emotions spiral into despair as every attempt to find his stolen bicycle fails. His journey from being an honest, hardworking man to someone who tries to steal a bicycle is tragic, especially since we’ve seen how good-hearted he was. The moment when Antonio is caught stealing in front of his son is his lowest point, a heartbreaking humiliation for someone who tried so hard to do the right thing. Bruno, though just a child, plays a crucial role in the story. His loyalty to his father and his maturity beyond his age add a lot of emotional depth. While his playful interactions with Antonio bring moments of lightness, watching his father’s moral fall is deeply sad. In the final scene, when Bruno holds his father’s hand after the failed theft, there’s a strong sense of forgiveness and understanding. Even though Bruno might not have fully understood what happened, this moment shows the unbreakable bond between father and son, no matter the hardships. The bicycle is also almost like a character itself in the film. It stands for hope and a means of survival. When it’s stolen, it creates a huge impact in Antonio’s life, triggering all the events that follow. Without it, he feels powerless, and the entire story revolves around his desperate attempt to recover not just the bicycle, but his self-respect.</p> <h3 id="directors-point-of-view">Director’s Point of View</h3> <p>Vittorio De Sica highlights struggles of the working class in postwar Italy. The film shows the harsh economic realities faced by everyday people, where a single misfortune can lead to losing everything. Antonio’s situation reflects the fragile balance between survival and despair. De Sica emphasizes how poverty and inequality can strip people of their dignity pushing them into difficult moral choices. The film explores what it means to be human, especially in desperate times. De Sica doesn’t blame Antonio for trying to steal a bicycle at the end of the film. Instead, he shows it as a sad but inevitable result of Antonio’s conditions. The film highlights that moral decisions are not always clear, especially in a world where people must often choose between survival and integrity.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>Bicycle Thieves is a brilliant film that explores themes of poverty, desperation, and the fragile dignity of the human spirit. The heartbreaking ending, where Antonio’s moral downfall reflects society’s failure to support its most vulnerable, feels both tragic and inevitable. Bruno’s presence adds an emotional layer, with his innocence highlighting the tough realities the adults must confront. One more interesting thing is that the title of the film itself hints a journey from being a victim to becoming a theif, which Antonio does, because the title contains plural form “theives”, not “theif”. I found it a very resonating and deep story, as it connected to our hearts with the desperate and sad moments shown. The film’s focus on ordinary people, real locations, and raw emotions makes it a timeless piece of cinema. However, like a typical old film, its slow pace and simple plot might not appeal to everyone, especially viewers used to modern, fast-paced films. Despite this, Bicycle Thieves remains a deeply moving and relatable story, showing the struggles of everyday life and how far people will go to hold onto their dignity when facing overwhelming hardship. It’s a powerful reflection on survival, love, and the human condition.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="DE410"/><category term="World_Cinema"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[DE410 (World Cinema) Movie Review]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Earth (1930)</title><link href="https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2024/Earth/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Earth (1930)"/><published>2024-08-30T15:12:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-30T15:12:00+00:00</updated><id>https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2024/Earth</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2024/Earth/"><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1ZfFjx30.jpg" height="300"/></div> <h3 id="plot-overview">Plot Overview</h3> <p>Earth (1930), directed by Alexander Dovzhenko, is a silent film about the transformative period of collectivization in rural Ukraine during the early Soviet era. The story is set in a village where struggle between traditional landowners and the new collective farming system is shown. The film begins with the death of an elderly farmer, symbolizing the end of an old era. As the village adopts collective farming, tensions arise, leading to conflicts between the peasants who support the collective and those who believe to be attached with the past. The story captures the social and political changes of the time, resulting in a tragic yet hopeful message about progress and change. The film explores the deep connection between humans and nature while portraying the ideological struggle of the time through its rich symbolism and poetic visuals.</p> <h3 id="conflict-and-resolution">Conflict and Resolution</h3> <p>At the heart of Earth is the conflict beten tradition and progress. The death of Vasyl (the protagonist) was very tragic, but it symbolizes the sacrifices that come along with change in the society. His murder by a kulak highlights the opposition to collectivization, but the film shows that this resistance is ultimately pointless. The commitment of villagers to their collective work after Vasyl’s death reinforces the idea that despite challenges, progress is unavoidable and ultimately for the betterment of society. Symbolism and Poetic Visuals Earth is pretty famous for its strong use of symbolism and imagery. Dovzhenko’s camera focuses on nature such as plants, animals, rain and the land. It highlights how all life is connected. In the opening scene, an old man and a child eat apples at the same time, which beautifully shows the circle of life, showing us the film’s themes of continuity and the cyclical nature of existence. The film’s visual style, with its long, thoughtful shots of rural life, matches the slow, steady rhythm of life on the farm. Another scene that starts with the rain also is an example showing the symbolic style which is captured in this film.</p> <h3 id="character-portrayal">Character Portrayal</h3> <p>Vasyl, the main character of the film, represents youthful idealism and hope for the future. His character isn’t deeply explored, but he symbolizes the new and collective era. The villagers are portrayed as a collective entity rather than as individuals, displaying the film’s themes of unity and shared effort. The kulaks are portrayed as the antagonists (like the bad guys), serve as symbols of resistance to progress, symbolizing the old ways that the film suggests need to be left behind for the greater good.</p> <h3 id="storytelling-and-narrative-structure">Storytelling and Narrative Structure</h3> <p>This movie focuses less on traditional storytelling and more on showing the changes in society. The film is made up of small scenes that, which when put together, create a powerful picture of rural life during an important time in Soviet history. The film uses images and visual metaphors to express themes like life, death, and renewal, making the film feel more like a visual poem than a straightforward story. This way of telling the story matches the natural, cyclical rhythms of the land and the people’s close connection to it.</p> <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk1XFjgn0.jpg" height="300"/></div> <h3 id="directors-vision-and-themes">Director’s Vision and Themes</h3> <p>Dovzhenko’s vision in Earth is deeply rooted in Soviet ideology, specifically the idea of collectivization as a necessary step toward progress. The movie acts as a piece of propaganda, highlighting the benefits of collective farming and the need for unity during times of change. But it goes beyond simple propaganda by exploring the spiritual and emotional sides of this transition. The film shows the unavoidable conflict between old traditions and new ways, with the collective farm representing the future. Dovzhenko portrays the peasants as both victims and drivers of change, giving the film a deeper and more thoughtful message about this complicated time in history. Another highlight is that how he manages to make the villain (like the one who seems to do bad things) get ignored in between the broader idea being depicted.</p> <h3 id="cinematography-and-visual-style">Cinematography and Visual Style</h3> <p>The cinematography in Earth is stunning. The way it used close-ups and landscape shots to create a deep connection between the characters and their surroundings was something which I liked. The film is filled with memorable images, like opening scene of the old farmer’s death and the beautiful scenes of the harvest. The natural light and shadows add to the film’s poetic feel, making it look like a tribute to the land and its people. Dovzhenko’s skill in capturing the rhythm of rural life through his camera work is one of the film’s lasting strengths.</p> <h3 id="observations-and-conclusion">Observations and Conclusion</h3> <p>While Earth is visually beautiful and full of deep themes, its abstract and symbolic style might be tough for today’s viewers who are used to more traditional stories. As a typical old 1930s film, I also felt that its pace is slow, and the lack of a straightforward plot can make it hard for some to connect with the characters emotionally. It took some time and effort for me also to understand whats going on in the film. Moreover, the clear propaganda elements might seem too strong, especially when watched outside the historical context. However, if we think about it, these are the distinguishing aspects which make Earth an important and influential piece of Soviet cinema.</p> <p>In conclusion, I would say that Earth (1930) is a visually poetic and politically charged film that contains Alexander Dovzhenko’s artistic vision. Its creative use of imagery and symbolism, along with its look at societal change, makes it a powerful movie that goes beyond its propaganda origins. Although its unique narrative style and slow pace might not appeal to everyone as people’s choices differ from one person to other, the film’s lasting impact and influence on cinema till this date are undeniable. In the end, also felt that it’s a must-see for those interested in film as an art form and in understanding Soviet-era storytelling.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="DE410"/><category term="World_Cinema"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[DE410 (World Cinema) Movie Review]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Battleship Potemkin</title><link href="https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2024/Battleship_Potemkin/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Battleship Potemkin"/><published>2024-08-23T15:12:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-23T15:12:00+00:00</updated><id>https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2024/Battleship_Potemkin</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2024/Battleship_Potemkin/"><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy0t9LvsC.png" height="300"/></div> <p><br/></p> <p>Battleship Potemkin is a classic Soviet silent film from 1925, that shows the story of a rebellion originating from a Russian battleship <strong>Potemkin</strong> during the 1905 revolution. The film is directed by <strong>Sergei Eisenstein</strong>, and it stands out not just for its historical significance, but also for its powerful way of telling a story, even if it is a silent film. The plot is centered around the crew’s uprising against their arrogant officers, sparked by being served rotten, maggot-infested meat. This revolt quickly escalates, leading to the sailors taking control of the ship, symbolizing a broader resistance against tyranny.</p> <p>The film starts with a scene where a normal sailor is randomly slapped on the back by an officer just for taking out his aggression when the sailors are sleeping. Then, as the sailors wake up, a sailor named <strong>Vakulinchuk</strong> gives a speech about revolt, this scene thus shows that a revolution mindset was developing in the sailors due to officers being oppressive and other political/social revolts happening during that time in Russia.</p> <p>The film’s plot was divided into 5 acts. In the first act, the main issue among all the crew which we see is that they are in terrible conditions with rotten food to eat. Although they try to have a say about it, but the ship doctor simply neglects their concern by declaring the food eatable. The sailors had to eat just bread and water. What struck me most here was how effectively Eisenstein captured and presented the emotions of sailors, by depicting some very intense scenes and making you feel the tension as well as desperation that sailors were experiencing.</p> <p>The other act of “Odessa Steps” was also a very iconic and powerful scene as it showed the rebellion’s uprising among the common people. The way Eisenstein used quick cuts and close-ups to build suspense is impressive, and also with proper background music adjusting according to need. The scene is both shocking and heartbreaking, showing the brutal crackdown on civilians, and it left a lasting impact on me. Specifically, I remember that part from here when initially a child and his mother were cheering, but suddenly the military comes and the child gets shooted, and the mother then desperately goes for help, but again, the military shoots her, which is just too brutal. Similarly when another mother tries to protect her baby, but can’t do it because of the chaos and dies. This shows the impact of a revolution on normal people, and how much they suffer.</p> <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkpsqIPiA.jpg" height="350"/></div> <h3 id="storytelling-and-narration">Storytelling and Narration</h3> <p>One of the film’s most remarkable aspects is how it transitions from the individual struggles of the sailors to the collective action of the whole society. Eisenstein doesn’t focus on a single hero; instead, he portrays the entire community of oppressed people as the protagonist. This approach reflects the film’s deeper message about the power of unity in the face of ruthless rule. The movie doesn’t have much dialogue, and the story is told mostly through visuals with some amount of text coming in between to make us understand. This felt a bit different because we are used to modern films, but it was amazing how much information they conveyed through expressions, body language, and framing of shots.</p> <h3 id="directors-film-making-style">Director’s film-making style</h3> <p>Eisenstein’s vision is clearly to touch upon the spirit of revolution and highlight the strength of collective action against oppression. Influenced by Marxist ideology, he uses the film not just to entertain but to inspire the audience, especially the working class. The absence of a traditional protagonist emphasizes that real change is driven by the masses, highlighting the film’s central theme of transformation through the unity of society.</p> <h3 id="silent-film-feature---cinematography-visuals-and-sound">Silent film feature - Cinematography, Visuals and Sound</h3> <p>Visually, Battleship Potemkin is stunning. The use of high-angle shots during the Odessa Steps scene effectively captures the terror and chaos experienced by the civilians, while close-ups of fearful faces draw us deeply into the collective suffering and resolve of the people. Despite being a silent film, its visual rhythm, and the later-added musical score keep the audience thoroughly engaged, making the narrative feel dynamic and emotionally connected. The sound as in the background music was also very nicely controlled and it accurately depicted the situation of a scene, especially when anything intense was going on.</p> <h3 id="observations-and-conclusion">Observations and Conclusion</h3> <p>Since the film is silent and from a completely different era, it might not be everyone’s cup of tea, and so sometimes I also found it a bit hard to understand what was going on in the movie. The pacing felt a bit slow sometimes compared to normal modern movies, and some parts felt overly dramatic. But if you appreciate film history, think about the influence of it, and the way many amazing things were portrayed through the film even though being with limited resources and being silent, I think Battleship Potemkin was definitely worth watching and inspiring film.</p> <p>In conclusion, I would say that it is a visually striking and politically charged film that remains highly influential even today. Its innovative use of montage, compelling collective narrative, and masterful cinematography solidify its status as a unique picture in cinematic history. Despite some aspects that may feel dated, the film’s powerful message and groundbreaking techniques continue to resonate, making it an unforgettable art of cinema!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="DE410"/><category term="World_Cinema"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[DE410 (World Cinema) Movie Review]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Separation</title><link href="https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2024/separation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Separation"/><published>2024-08-09T15:12:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-09T15:12:00+00:00</updated><id>https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2024/separation</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2024/separation/"><![CDATA[<p><br/></p> <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S19RgkEcC.jpg"/></div> <p><br/></p> <p>“A Separation” is a film from Iranian cinema whose plot is about story of an Iranian middle class married couple named <em>Nader</em> (husband) and <em>Simin</em> (wife), who are unfortunately on the verge of having a divorce. The film is directed by <strong>Asghar Farhadi</strong>, a prominent filmmaker from Iranian cinema, and in this film he depicts various problems faced by middle-class families in a society. The film shows us complexities of family relationships by displaying issues in Nader and Simin’s relationship and the impact of their separation on their daughter, <em>Termeh</em>. The film also explores the responsibilities and sacrifices inherent in familial duties, particularly through Nader’s commitment to his elderly father.</p> <p>The film starts with the decision of divorce being made between Simin, Nader and an official. The art style of filmmaker can be noticed here as this scene is presented in such a way that it makes the audience feel as if the couple is talking to them and showing their problems. So, it makes the audience to build an early interest in the story by making them to judge the condition of the couple. Simin expresses that she wants to leave Iran inorder to provide better opportunities to their daughter, but Nader feels not to because he wants to take care of this old-aged father, who has Alzheimers disease. Therefore, they are in a condition of divorce, and this decision then leads to many problems and mis-happenings in their life as well as in life of a worker named <em>Razieh</em> who was hired by the family to take care of the house while they are away.</p> <p>A very interesting point about the film which I liked is that we clearly know the origin of all the problems, that is the divorce decision. But after this origin, we can’t really blame someone for the problems. It is like stuck in a loop, where almost every character is reasonable as well as guilty at the same time for the events occurred. For example, if we just think about finding what caused Razieh’s child being killed, first thought might be Nader pushing her, but after going through many reasons, it boils down to the fact that why she was working so much even when pregnant without informing her husband, the answer is the need of money for paying her husband’s debt, as they were poor. Now, we are stuck because we couldn’t find a total bad person, and cannot just blame poverty for all of this after an extent. We can just say that there was a little bit of issue in this or that character, but they were not completely wrong.</p> <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJgHeJN9R.png"/></div> <p>The character depiction is also done beautifully in the film -</p> <ul> <li>Nader is portrayed as a responsible son who has a job to do along with managing his family and old-aged father whom he loves and cares. But, Nader is also somewhat selfish in the sense that he does not cares much about the desires of people around him.</li> <li>Simin is a determined woman who seeks to have a better future of her daughter. The desire of Simin to leave Iran was not about her personal choice, but for providing good opportunities to Termeh. The character also shows struggles of such a woman in the society.</li> <li>Termeh is an intelligent, young, understandable and good girl, who is affected the most by the divorce. Although she always tried to unite Nader and Simin, but it didn’t happened. The points in the film where she noticed Nader was lying and when she handles the conversation with the judge about the same displays her smartness. But, in the end, we do see how sad she is about the separation.</li> <li>Razieh, the care-worker, is a very religious woman, but poor and in a kind of miserable situation, who had to do a lot of struggle. Her character adds layers of complexity to the story, specially through her moral and religious dilemmas. We can also see the problems faced by her daughter who goes along with her and would be seeing such difficulties at an early age.</li> <li>Hodjat, husband of Razieh, is a short-tempered unemployed and in-debt person, who adds on to the tensions of the poor family. His character shows the frustation and helplessness felt by many lower-class families.</li> </ul> <p>Another point which I liked was about those 2-3 points where plot twists happened. One of them is whrn we initially think Nader is innocent and is not responsible for miscarriage of Razieh’s child, but then during a conversation between Termen and Nader, we get to know that he indeed knew about it. So, we start thinking in this direction. But, now as think that Nader is a little-bit guilty, we finally see that child died due to some carelessness from Razieh’s side only. But as I told before, we are not able to find someone completely responsible for this incident. So, one of the film’s strengths which I feel is its portrayal of moral ambiguity. The characters’ decisions are having dilemmas, and the film does not provide easy answers. Razieh’s struggle with her daughter, Nader’s actions, and Simin’s decisions all such examples.</p> <p>One more hidden detail which I noticed some time after the movie ended was that the money which got missing and due to which Nader suspected Razieh was actually missing because in the very start of the film, we see Simin and some workers talking about money for extra floor. Simin would have given it to them, but didn’t informed Nader about this as they were not talking to each other. Now, this is just <em>crazy</em> that how this small act affected the whole storyline.</p> <p>We can see that the filmmaker Asghar Farhadi’s direction is subtle yet powerful. He uses long takes and close-ups to create an intimate atmosphere, drawing viewers into the characters’ emotional states. The film’s naturalistic style and use of real locations enhance its authenticity. Farhadi’s focus on small tasks of everyday life and his attention to detail contribute to the film’s realism. As we discussed in class as well, that if we notice the camera position was not so stable, but that was a style which actually a more natural effect on the movie.</p> <p>Finally, I would conclude by saying that I found “A Separation” to be an emotional and thought-provoking film, which justified its title well. In the end, the movies again reaches to the divorce condition showing Termeh in the court, but lefts the decision of Termeh open to viewes thoughts, which is also a style which makes viewers think about the story even after movie ends. Overall, it was a good film about personal &amp; social conflicts, extending its relevance beyond Iranian society by touching universal ideas of family, justice, and moral reponsibilities, making it a timeless as well as impactfull piece of world cinema!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="DE410"/><category term="World_Cinema"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[DE410 (World Cinema) Movie Review]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bridging the Gap in Joint Speech-Language Training - Introducing ComSL</title><link href="https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2024/comsl/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bridging the Gap in Joint Speech-Language Training - Introducing ComSL"/><published>2024-04-20T15:12:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-20T15:12:00+00:00</updated><id>https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2024/comsl</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2024/comsl/"><![CDATA[<p>In the realm of speech &amp; language in machine learning, we often come across spoken language tasks like Speech translation, summarization, understanding etc. In recent years, an end-to-end (E2E) modeling approach has been widely applied to such tasks, where a single model is trained using E2E optimizations with task-oriented metrics. Conventional approaches employing separate speech and language models have faced several challenges such as scarcity of training data, high GPU computation, and effect of modality gap between speech &amp; language (a significant one). To overcome these problems, a groundbreaking solution has emerged :fire: -</p> <p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ-1dv-bR.png" alt="ComSL : A Composite Speech-Language Model for End-to-End Speech-to-Text Translation"/></p> <p>In this blog, we delve into solving &amp; understanding the above mentioned problems faced in joint speech-language training, as well as explore the promising ideas presented by ComSL to revolutionize the field.</p> <blockquote> <p>First of all, why do these challenges emerge and how do they post a big problem?</p> </blockquote> <p>A conventional E2E model pipeline design generally consists of 2 modules :</p> <pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph TD;
E2E_Model--&gt;Speech_Module;
E2E_Model--&gt;Language_Module;
Speech_Module--&gt;id1(decodes input speech into text);
Language_Module--&gt;id2(infers recognized text to target language or intent);
</code></pre> <p>These 2 modules are trained using their own respective criteria, which may not be optimal for each other. Therefore, the <em>cascaded</em> process may propagate errors that might have occured in a current module to the one following it. Also, since other information like prosodic features are contained in the speech, it becomes difficult to quantize them using language symbols, however they can be beneficial for spoken language tasks.</p> <blockquote> <p>So that’s how the modality gap between the modules is a challenge. What about the other ones?</p> </blockquote> <p>Although unified speech language pretraining based on Transformer architecture has largely boosted E2E modeling for spoken language tasks. In such models, pretraining is conducted jointly on unlabeled speech, unlabeled text, paired speech-to-text and paired text-to-text in multiple languages using both supervised and self-supervised learning. The unified representation from both modalities are simultaneously learned via shared model parameters or auxiliary modality matching losses in pretraining stage. But, as pretrained speech-only and language-only models are becoming increasing powerful, to achieve a comparable performance with such a cascaded module system, unified speech-language pretraining must leverage same or larger scale of data used in only models, which makes training very challenging, because such large amount of required data is not easy to get :(</p> <blockquote> <p>Lack of GPU resources and time is always a problem, you know, we realized this when doing ASR assignments :)</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="comsl-enters-the-chat">ComSL enters the chat</h3> <p>With an innovative blend of transfer learning and cross-modality learning, ComSL streamlines the joint training of speech and language through a multi-task learning framework -</p> <ul> <li>It fully leverages existing pretrained models, no need for pretraining with large data from scratch, directly fine-tune it for downstream tasks, hence data efficient</li> <li>Conventional approaches use contrastive learning among modalities, which require external or internal aligners to force-align speech &amp; text at token/word level.

Formally, we have to find the most likely sequence $y = {y_1, y_2, \ldots , y_N}$ (eg. words or characters) of length $N$ in $L_2$ given acoustic features $s = {s_1, s_2, \ldots , s_T}$ (eg. Mel Filter Bank features) of length $T$ in $L_1$. A Speech Translation (ST) corpus $D^{ST} = {(s, x, y)}$ generally contains $x = {x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_M}$ (i.e. the transcription of speech in source language), in addition to $y$ and $s$. This allows to use Machine Translation (MT) and ASR as auxiliary tasks in a <strong>Multi-Task</strong> learning manner during optimization of E2E ST model, combinging the losses as -</p> \[L = L_{ST} + L_{MT} + L_{ASR}\] <blockquote> <p>What is this Multitasking now &amp; Why? <em>(screwing up several things at once :))</em></p> </blockquote> <p>In machine learning, multi-task learning (MTL) is a powerful tool that allows different tasks to share common knowledge, boosting overall performance. However, in practice, it faces challenges. For instance, while automatic speech recognition (ASR) can enhance speech representations, the strict alignment required between speech and text can hinder tasks with significant differences in word order. Meanwhile, machine translation (MT) tasks can act as guides for speech-to-text tasks, as mapping text to text is generally easier than mapping speech to text. Yet, the mismatch between speech and text modalities may weaken this guidance’s effectiveness. Thus, while MTL holds promise, navigating these complexities is key to maximizing its benefits!</p> <h3 id="model-architecture">Model Architecture</h3> <p align="center"> <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkTe8eJZA.png" alt="ComSL" width="600"/> </p> <p>Following the previous works by top-class respected researchers, the model is taken to be a composite model mainly composed of 3 components :</p> <ol> <li><strong>Speech Transformer Blocks</strong> : Encoder which acts as a powerful speech representation extractor, initialized with encoder parameters of <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">whisper model</a> :bulb: which has strong performance on speech-to-text as well as translation tasks</li> <li><strong>Adapter</strong> : consists of 2 layers, each composed of a feed-forward module and a 1-D convolution layer with 2 stride, achieving 4 times down-sampling for speech encoder outputs in total. Also, the non-linearity of feed-forward module can speed up adaptation of speech representations to be fed into language Transformer blocks</li> <li><strong>Language Transformer Blocks</strong> : initialized with <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/mbart">mBART model</a>, composed of 12 encoder and 12 decoder layers with model dimension of 1024 on 16 heads. It is pretrained on monolingual data and fine-tuned on paired MT data and thus capable of many-to-many translation. All its parameters are used to enhance the translation capability of ComSL.</li> </ol> <p>Note that, as we told before, that ComSL leverages the existing pre-trained models, all of these components are initialized by some pretrained model except the adapter</p> <h2 id="cross-modality-learningcml-crown">Cross-modality learning (CML) :crown:</h2> <p>CML is a key component of ComSL introduced in the paper. In the previous Loss equation, we can feed speech-only and text-only inputs into the model to learn ST, ASR and MT tasks. But we wanted to ==minimize the gap between speech and text modalities== and so, we introduce CML based on paired speech-text input. The approach used is such that it intrinsically learns cross-modality information during model optimization, which is different from other approaches which rely on external forced-alignment methods to determine word/unit boundaries.</p> <p align="center"> <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkQo3OWZA.png" alt="CML" width="600"/> </p> <p>CML involves the following steps -</p> <ol> <li><strong>Speech-Text Concatenation</strong> - For utilizing paired speech-text data, concatenate the speech embedding $e^s$ (from adapter) and text embeddings $e^x$ (from tokenizer) are concatenated and pass them as input to mBART encoder for further processing</li> <li><strong>Masked Token Prediction (MTP)</strong> - involves randomly masking text tokens in the concatenated input and training the model to predict these masked tokens. The model learns to fill in the missing tokens based on their corresponding speech embeddings, establishing a strong relation between speech and text modalities.</li> <li><strong>Speech to Text Mapping (STM)</strong> - In this task, the model learns to map the input speech to the target text by conditioning the encoder output hidden state on both the input speech and the masked ground-truth transcription. The goal is to generate accurate representations that align speech and text.</li> <li><strong>Encoder Representation Matching (ERM)</strong> - To align speech-only representations with the concatenated input, ComSL employs a loss function that encourages the speech-only representation to be closer to the concatenated representation. This loss is applied to the hidden states of the text encoder, bridging the gap between the modalities.</li> <li><strong>Decoder Distribution Matching (DDM)</strong> - DDM enhances the performance of the speech translation (ST) task by leveraging the output distribution of the machine translation (MT) task. By incorporating MT output into the ST loss, the model benefits from the better performance of MT and improves its translation capabilities.</li> </ol> <p>These cross-modality learning tasks collectively contribute to the overall performance of ComSL by minimizing the gap between speech and text representations. By incorporating these techniques, ComSL achieves remarkable results in end-to-end speech-to-text translation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and data efficiency.</p> <blockquote> <p>But, how is the main training done with all of these many things incorporated?</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="training-strategies">Training Strategies</h2> <p>ComSL employs several training strategies and follows a well-defined pipeline to optimize the performance and effectiveness of the model. Here is an overview of the training strategies and pipeline utilized in ComSL:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Fine-tuning Language Model</strong> - Before the model composition, it is fine-tuned with all paired text training data by integrating the mBART-50 model. As we observed, mBART has a good extension capability so that it can achieve decent performance even on unseen languages by fine-tuning with limited data. On the other hand, since Whisper has been already trained with data in 100 languages, fine-tuning it has less impact on the final performance.</li> <li><strong>Multi-task Learning</strong> - ComSL utilizes MTL to train not only ST task (main) but also auxiliary tasks (AST and MT). Multiple loss functions are used such as negative log likelihood loss (for ASR), sequence-to-sequence mapping loss (for ST), cross-entropy loss (for MT) and the final loss $L_{total}$ is takes as weighted sum of these losses - \(L_{total} = w_{asr} * L_{ASR} + w_{st} * L_{ST} + w_{mt} * L_{MT} + w_{CML} * L_{CML}\) Multi-task learning allows shared knowledge and information to be effectively utilized among different tasks, enhancing the overall performance.</li> <li><strong>Regularization on MT Output</strong> - As the language transformer block (mBART-50) were fine-tuned with MT tasks, they can overfit in multi-learning for composite model. So, to prevent overfitting, introduce an additional language model $\theta’$ (fine-tuned mBART-50) and freeze its parameters during training. Also, add a cross-entropy loss to minimize the difference of their output distributions. This operation is similar to that in ST task, i.e., <em>using a better task as a teacher to guide a relatively worse task</em>. This regularization technique ensures the generalization and stability of the MT task within ComSL.</li> <li><strong>Freezing Speech Encoder</strong> - If you remember, the speech and language transformer blocks are initialized by well-trained speech-only and text-only models, while the adapter is randomly initialized. So, these three components should use different learning rates during the training. For this, <em>freeze</em> the speech encoder at the first few epochs. This retains powerful speech representations during the early stage of fine-tuning when the gradients are unstable. The language component has the regularization on the MT output that plays a similar role.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>So, that is how it is done, what was to be done. Let’s see the outcome of all this hardwork -</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="experiments--results">Experiments &amp; Results</h2> <h3 id="datasets">Datasets</h3> <ol> <li><strong>E2E ST Data</strong> Experiments were conducted on the ==CoVoST2 dataset==, rich in multilingual speech translations. Our focus? The non-English to English translations (X-EN) using around 400 hours of English recordings and 900 hours from 21 other languages.</li> <li><strong>Pseudo ST Data</strong> To make up for data for low-resource language pairs in CoVoST2, we cleverly integrated unlabeled translations (translated the transcriptions into English) from Mozilla Common Voice dataset using the mBART model, effectively expanding the dataset by approximately 300 hours across 16 languages.</li> </ol> <h3 id="experimental-setup">Experimental Setup</h3> <p>Two versions of model, named <strong>ComSL Medium</strong> and <strong>ComSL Large</strong> are used in experiments. ComSL Medium uses a Whisper medium encoder with 24 layers of Transformer blocks with 1024 hidden dimensions and 16 heads. On the other hand, ComSL Large steps it up with a larger Whisper encoder using 32 layers of Transformer blocks, 1280 hidden dimensions, and 20 heads. Both versions are equipped with a two-layer convolution adapter and initialized with the mBART model, with parameters totaling 0.9 billion for ComSL Medium and 1.3 billion for ComSL Large.</p> <p>Models underwent rigorous training on GPU clusters, trimmed audio recordings, and employed optimization techniques like deepspeed ZeRo and activation checkpointing. During inference, we unleashed beam search with a beam size of 5 and evaluated BLEU scores using sacreBLEU.</p> <h3 id="main-results">Main Results</h3> <p>The main results are shown in Table1. We divide the 21 test languages into three groups: High-resource, Medium-resource, and Low-resource. With average BLEU scores in hand, we then compare and contrast the performance of ComSL Medium and Large against their predecessors, Whisper Medium and Large. With BLEU scores of 29.7 and 30.1, respectively, ==ComSL Medium and Large outshine Whisper Medium and Large==</p> <p>The main factors contributing to this improvement are:</p> <ul> <li>Replacement of the Whisper decoder with mBART</li> <li>The application of our training strategies and losses in training the combined Whisper and mBART models</li> </ul> <p>Both ComSL Medium and ComSL Large (with a BLEU score of 31.5, which is 0.8 higher than USM with 0.7B fewer parameters) outperform USM when pseudo ST data is used. But there’s still a performance dip attributed to ASR errors when compared to employing ground-truth transcription as inputs for MT.</p> <p align="center"> <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJzbcgW-0.png" alt="results_table" width="600"/> </p> <h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3> <h4 id="ablation-study-on-training-tasks-losses-and-strategies">Ablation Study on training tasks, losses and strategies</h4> <div> <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByO-APZW0.png" alt="drawing" width="310" height="130" style="float:right"/> </div> <p>In a series of ablation studies, ComSL Medium’s performance was analyzed. Initially trained only with the Speech-to-Text (ST) loss, it achieved a BLEU score of 26.48. Adding the Machine Translation (MT) task led to a marginal decrease to 26.31, indicating that directly applying MT task doesn’t directly improve performance. Adding more tasks like Distilled Dual Matching (DDM), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and freezing speech encoder parameters early in training, MT regularization, cross modality learning (CML) loss and pseudo ST data improved the results significantly to a BLEU score of 30.77.</p> <h4 id="comparison-across-different-cross-modality-learning-cml-methods">Comparison across different Cross-Modality Learning (CML) methods</h4> <div style="text-align:center"> <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1_ZRDb-A.png" alt="drawing" width="280" height="100" style="float:right"/> </div> <p>The baseline model is trained with all strategies and tasks except the methods of minimizing modality gap. It’s performance is compared with our CML, previous MML, ConST and WACO methods. Our CML performs best with an average BLEU score of 29.69. MML is a close runner-up but it requires internal alignment at the tokens which makes the training process more expensive.</p> <p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkdZCvWWA.png" alt="image_2024-04-20_22-01-09"/></p> <p>Similarity matrices of speech and text representations, give us a further insight into what happens after CML tasks. The model demonstrates strong text and speech representation alignment even without explicit modality gap minimization, likely benefiting from ASR task knowledge. Cross-Modal Learning (CML) enhances this alignment, creating unified representations even for non-speech tokens like punctuation and silence (illustrated by the green box in the figure). This precise encoding of speech information is a unique feature of CML.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>In summary, ComSL provides a transformative solution to the challenges in joint speech-language training, revolutionizing the way we approach spoken language tasks. The aim of bridging the gap between speech and text representations was achieved through cross-modality learning tasks, in addition to other auxiliary tasks like ASR and MT. The composite model outperformed the constituent speech model (Whisper) or cascaded speech and language models (Whisper+mBART). With its state-of-the-art performance, data efficiency, and innovative cross-modality learning, ComSL sets the stage for a new era of advancements in speech and language processing!</p> <h3 id="references">References</h3> <ul> <li>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14838.pdf</li> <li>https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/72758</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ML"/><category term="ASR"/><category term="speech_translation"/><category term="CML"/><category term="multi-task_learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[CS753 (ASR) Spring'24 Blogger Role]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">GPU Computing and Beyond</title><link href="https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2023/gpu-computing-and-beyond/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GPU Computing and Beyond"/><published>2023-04-08T18:19:03+00:00</published><updated>2023-04-08T18:19:03+00:00</updated><id>https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2023/gpu-computing-and-beyond</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2023/gpu-computing-and-beyond/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Core-Generators for RISC-V</title><link href="https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2023/core-generators-for-risc-v/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Core-Generators for RISC-V"/><published>2023-03-19T21:33:27+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-19T21:33:27+00:00</updated><id>https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2023/core-generators-for-risc-v</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://atishay25.github.io/blog/2023/core-generators-for-risc-v/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry></feed>
