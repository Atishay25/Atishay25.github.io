### Rail Fan

The hum of the tracks, the allure of journeys â€” Indian Railways is where my wanderlust meets my love for mechanics. I like knowing about railways since childhood. I hate traveling in any other medium, specially in cars/buses, but I loved traveling in trains. Sometimes I just randomly see running status of trains and just like to know a lot about how the entire system works. My fav engine is obviously the WAP7 (White Beast), followed by his brother WAP5, and then many others like WAP4 (classic), WAG9, WAG7, WDM3, WDP4D etc. Regarding trains, there are many many which I like, one of them is the legendary Punjab Mail :fire:
