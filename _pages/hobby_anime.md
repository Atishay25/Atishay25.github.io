### Anime

Immersed in the world of anime, where every story is an adventure and every character, an inspiration. I am not a very hardcore anime watcher, I have watched only some very famous kind of animes only like 
- One Piece
- Attack on Titan
- Death Note
- Dragon Ball
- Demon Slayer
- Jujutsu Kaisen
- Spy x family
- Bayblade, Pokemon
- Movies like Suzume, I want to eat your Pancreas, some Haikyuu movie as well

Among these, currently One Piece is one of my most favourite, and I am still reading its manga (I caught upto manga around October 2023). My fav character is Akagami no Shanks :fire:
