### Marvel 

From my childhood time's cartoons to the big screen, the Marvel Universe is my escape into a world of heroes and legends. Just a matter of fact, Ironman > > > > > Captain America.

If I think about it, the first hero of marvel universe whom I would have known in my life would be Spiderman, but I got introduced to MCU by Ironman. There was some very good and different style kind of cartoon show of Ironman which I used to watch when I was 9 years old. Then, slowly I started watching human movies as well, and then we all know how the endgame happened in 2019 with connecting every dots. Among all MCU characters, I am always the biggest fan of Tony Stark (Ironman), followed by Thor, Spidey, and then others. I remember that even during my freshie year intro into IITB, there was some google form given to write your aim, and I didn't knew that it was supposed to be for fun, but I, very seriously wrote my acutal aim in it, that is, I came into this institue to learn about how to become Ironman. Somehow, these guys took it as joke, and displayed my answer as the best answer xD
