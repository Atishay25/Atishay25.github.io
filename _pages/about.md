Kon'nichiwa!

I’m Atishay, a final year undergrad at IIT Bombay pursuing B.Tech in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in). I am diving deep into the world of algorithms, AI, and everything in between. Although I’m a little bit afraid of swimming, I am still diving into it. My core interests include machine learning, quantitative analysis and software engineering. I was born and raised in the vibrant town of Tikamgarh, Madhya Pradesh.

When I'm not tinkering with tech, you might find me chasing the horizon of what's possible—or maybe just chilling with a good anime or playing the keyboard. After all, Kaizoku Ou Ni Naru Otokuda!
