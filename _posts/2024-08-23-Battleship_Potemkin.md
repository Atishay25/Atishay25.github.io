Battleship Potemkin is a classic Soviet silent film from 1925, that shows the story of a rebellion originating from a Russian battleship **Potemkin** during the 1905 revolution. The film is directed by **Sergei Eisenstein**, and it stands out not just for its historical significance, but also for its powerful way of telling a story, even if it is a silent film. The plot is centered around the crew's uprising against their arrogant officers, sparked by being served rotten, maggot-infested meat. This revolt quickly escalates, leading to the sailors taking control of the ship, symbolizing a broader resistance against tyranny. 

The film starts with a scene where a normal sailor is randomly slapped on the back by an officer just for taking out his aggression when the sailors are sleeping. Then, as the sailors wake up, a sailor named **Vakulinchuk** gives a speech about revolt, this scene thus shows that a revolution mindset was developing in the sailors due to officers being oppressive and other political/social revolts happening during that time in Russia. 

The film's plot was divided into 5 acts. In the first act, the main issue among all the crew which we see is that they are in terrible conditions with rotten food to eat. Although they try to have a say about it, but the ship doctor simply neglects their concern by declaring the food eatable. The sailors had to eat just bread and water. What struck me most here was how effectively Eisenstein captured and presented the emotions of sailors, by depicting some very intense scenes and making you feel the tension as well as desperation that sailors were experiencing. 

The other act of "Odessa Steps" was also a very iconic and powerful scene as it showed the rebellion's uprising among the common people. The way Eisenstein used quick cuts and close-ups to build suspense is impressive, and also with proper background music adjusting according to need. The scene is both shocking and heartbreaking, showing the brutal crackdown on civilians, and it left a lasting impact on me. Specifically, I remember that part from here when initially a child and his mother were cheering, but suddenly the military comes and the child gets shooted, and the mother then desperately goes for help, but again, the military shoots her, which is just too brutal. Similarly when another mother tries to protect her baby, but can't do it because of the chaos and dies. This shows the impact of a revolution on normal people, and how much they suffer.

### Storytelling and Narration 

One of the film's most remarkable aspects is how it transitions from the individual struggles of the sailors to the collective action of the whole society. Eisenstein doesn’t focus on a single hero; instead, he portrays the entire community of oppressed people as the protagonist. This approach reflects the film's deeper message about the power of unity in the face of ruthless rule. The movie doesn’t have much dialogue, and the story is told mostly through visuals with some amount of text coming in between to make us understand. This felt a bit different because we are used to modern films, but it was amazing how much information they conveyed through expressions, body language, and framing of shots. 

### Director's film-making style
Eisenstein's vision is clearly to touch upon the spirit of revolution and highlight the strength of collective action against oppression. Influenced by Marxist ideology, he uses the film not just to entertain but to inspire the audience, especially the working class. The absence of a traditional protagonist emphasizes that real change is driven by the masses, highlighting the film's central theme of transformation through the unity of society.

### Silent film feature - Cinematography, Visuals and Sound
Visually, Battleship Potemkin is stunning. The use of high-angle shots during the Odessa Steps scene effectively captures the terror and chaos experienced by the civilians, while close-ups of fearful faces draw us deeply into the collective suffering and resolve of the people. Despite being a silent film, its visual rhythm, and the later-added musical score keep the audience thoroughly engaged, making the narrative feel dynamic and emotionally connected. The sound as in the background music was also very nicely controlled and it accurately depicted the situation of a scene, especially when anything intense was going on.

### Observations and Conclusion
Since the film is silent and from a completely different era, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, and so sometimes I also found it a bit hard to understand what was going on in the movie. The pacing felt a bit slow sometimes compared to normal modern movies, and some parts felt overly dramatic. But if you appreciate film history, think about the influence of it, and the way many amazing things were portrayed through the film even though being with limited resources and being silent, I think Battleship Potemkin was definitely worth watching and inspiring film.

In conclusion, I would say that it is a visually striking and politically charged film that remains highly influential even today. Its innovative use of montage, compelling collective narrative, and masterful cinematography solidify its status as a unique picture in cinematic history. Despite some aspects that may feel dated, the film's powerful message and groundbreaking techniques continue to resonate, making it an unforgettable art of cinema!
